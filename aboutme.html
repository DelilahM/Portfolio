    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a proud Oaklander! I was raised and grew up in Oakland Chinatown. I go to Oakland Charter High School (OCHS), and Biology is one of my favorite classes! At OCHS, I am part of the Student Government and Key Club. I am passionate about the Oakland community, and advocate change for the better of society. When I am not being productive, I enjoy playing video games for several hours.</p>
