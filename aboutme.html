	  <h1>Welcome</h1>	
	<p>Thank you for visting my website! I am Melody Cao, a fellow intern for Girls Who Code at Twitter. I have a great interest in Computer Science, and I am ecstatic to be learning how to code this summer.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a proud Oaklander! I was raised and grew up in Oakland Chinatown. I go to Oakland Charter High School (OCHS), and Biology is one of my favorite classes! At OCHS, I am part of the Student Government and Key Club. I am passionate about the Oakland community, and advocate change for the better of society. When I am not being productive, I enjoy playing video games for several hours.</p>
